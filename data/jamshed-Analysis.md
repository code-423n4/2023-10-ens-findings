# Introduction

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

ENS has similar goals to DNS, the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture.

# Audit approach

1.  Read the documentation.
2.  Try to understand how the system works by looking at the ENS website
3.  Look at each code individually and focus on the internal function calls.
4.  Read the test files to get a better idea of the end-to-end scenarios.

## Codebase Analysis

- The codebase is well-structured and follows Solidity's best practices. The contracts are well-documented, which aids in understanding the functionality and purpose of each contract. The use of libraries for common functions helps to reduce code duplication and increase readability. However, the complexity of the system could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

## Codebase Quality Summary

I would grade the codebase quality as high. Most of the methods were inherent and best practices were followed very well.

The codebase was commented thoroughly and was relatively easier to understand than the other audits. However, some of the methods were pretty long, and the contracts were just too long to understand everything going on there. For the new code that has been implemented, there is an opportunity to reduce the contract and method sizes and break them down into more digestible sizes.

## How could they have done it better?

While the provided code seems to be functional, there are always areas for improvement to ensure better security, efficiency, and readability in the contract and the protocol.

- Here are some potential areas for improvement:
    
- **Modularization**: Break down the code into smaller, well-defined functions and contracts. This makes the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
    
- **Comments and Documentation**: Provide thorough comments and documentation throughout the code to explain the purpose, functionality, and any potential gotchas of each component.
    
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or attacks. For example, checking that input amounts are positive, non-zero, and within reasonable bounds.
    
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and descriptive variable and function names to make the code more understandable.
    
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimize the code for gas efficiency. This involves minimizing unnecessary computations, storage, and external calls to save on transaction costs.
    
- **Avoid Reentrancy Vulnerabilities**: Implement safeguards to prevent reentrancy attacks, such as using the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern and using the reentrancyGuard modifier to prevent multiple calls to the same function.
    
- **Use Latest Solidity Version**: Keep up-to-date with the latest Solidity version and use its latest features and improvements.
    

## Centralization Risk

All the governance controls seem like centralization risks throughout the code, as has been pointed out here:

## 3- Test analysis

The audit scope of the contracts to be reviewed is 100% and that's awesome.
