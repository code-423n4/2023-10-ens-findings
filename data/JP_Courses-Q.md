0. QA: strongly recommended to use a more recent `pragma solidity` version and without the floating `^` bit, which could allow for introduction of vulnerabilities and other unexpected issues when new future versions are released.

1. ERC20MultiDelegate::_processDelegation() - Use of `assert()` in this function is not appropriate, and it should be replaced with `require()`. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L118-L137
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L131

(This is both a gas optimization and QA/LOW finding.)

Summary:

The usage of `assert()` in the `_processDelegation` function is not appropriate for the given context. The condition being checked, i.e. whether `amount` is less than or equal to `balance`, should use `require()` instead of `assert()`.

DESCRIPTION/PoC:

The key difference between `assert()` and `require()` is how they handle error conditions and gas consumption:

- `require()`: Use `require()` to check preconditions or validate (user) inputs; if the condition isn't met, the function reverts with a gas refund, making it suitable for handling user errors and expected conditions where graceful failure is needed.

- `assert()`: Use `assert()` for internal consistency checks, such as invariants; when an `assert()` statement fails, it signifies a bug or unexpected state. 
This is used to verify conditions that should never be false and, if such a condition evaluates as false, it reverts the transaction without gas refund, primarily serving to detect developer mistakes.

For this case, the function is checking whether `amount` is less than or equal to `balance`, and if this condition is not met, it should be considered an expected error condition rather than a bug in the code. 
Therefore, using `require()` is more appropriate.
 
Recommendation:

Replace the `assert()` statement with `require()` to improve error handling & gas consumption and provide a clear reason for the revert in the event of the condition not being met.

Here's the modified code with the `assert()` statement replaced by `require()`:
```solidity
function _processDelegation(
    address source,
    address target,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 balance = getBalanceForDelegate(source);

--  assert(amount <= balance);
++  require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");

    deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(target);
    transferBetweenDelegators(source, target, amount);
    
    emit DelegationProcessed(source, target, amount);
}
```
The change from `assert()` to `require()` in the `_processDelegation` function provides improved error handling, better gas efficiency, and clearer reasoning for reverts, enhancing user-friendliness and contract robustness.


2. LOW: ERC20MultiDelegate::_reimburse() - No check for bool return value for transferFrom() method.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L148

The concern arises from the absence of checks on the success or boolean return values of token transfers. It's advisable to either use `safeTransferFrom` or explicitly check return values, aligning with industry-standard recommendations

RISKS:

The potential consequences and risks of not checking the return value of the `transferFrom` method in the `_reimburse` function depend on the behavior of the `token` contract and how it handles failed transfers. 

Potential issues:

- Lack of Error Handling: 
If the `transferFrom` method in the `token` contract encounters an error, it will return `false`, indicating that the transfer failed. 
However, if the `_reimburse` function does not check this return value, it may not be aware of transfer failures. This could lead to a situation where tokens are not transferred as expected, but the function assumes they have been.

- Inconsistent State: Without checking the return value, the internal state of the contract may be inconsistent with the actual token ownership. For example, the contract might record a successful reimbursement, even if the token transfer failed.

Recommendations:

Use OZ's `safeTransferFrom` or explicit return value checks, in accordance with industry-standard recommendations.

For using the explicit return value checks approach (until OZ's `safeTransferFrom` is implemented):

You can use the return value from `token.transferFrom` to handle errors and take appropriate actions, such as logging the failure, reverting the transaction, notifying the user, etc.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `_reimburse` function to handle transfer failures: 
```solidity
function _reimburse(address source, uint256 amount) internal {
    address proxyAddressFrom = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, source);
--  token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
++  bool transferSuccess = token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
++  require(transferSuccess, "Token transfer failed"); // Add error handling

    // Rest of the function logic
}
```
By adding this error handling code, you can ensure that the contract responds appropriately to failed token transfers, reducing the potential risks associated with not checking the return value.


3. QA: ERC20MultiDelegate::setUri() - Method `_setURI(uri)` does not adhere to the EIP-1155 specification, as it does not emit an event, however there's a valid explanation for the reason in ERC1155.sol contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L152

Valid explanation in ERC1155.sol contract on L244-L245:
`Because these URIs cannot be meaningfully represented by the {URI} event, this function emits no events.`

```solidity
    function setUri(string memory uri) external onlyOwner {
        _setURI(uri);
    }
```
