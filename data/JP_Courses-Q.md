0. QA: strongly recommended to use a more recent `pragma solidity` version and without the floating `^` bit, which could allow for introduction of vulnerabilities and other unexpected issues when new future versions are released.

1. ERC20MultiDelegate::_processDelegation() - Use of `assert()` in this function is not appropriate, and it should be replaced with `require()`. 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L118-L137
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L131

(This is both a gas optimization and QA/LOW finding.)

Summary:

The usage of `assert()` in the `_processDelegation` function is not appropriate for the given context. The condition being checked, i.e. whether `amount` is less than or equal to `balance`, should use `require()` instead of `assert()`.

DESCRIPTION/PoC:

The key difference between `assert()` and `require()` is how they handle error conditions and gas consumption:

- `require()`: Use `require()` to check preconditions or validate (user) inputs; if the condition isn't met, the function reverts with a gas refund, making it suitable for handling user errors and expected conditions where graceful failure is needed.

- `assert()`: Use `assert()` for internal consistency checks, such as invariants; when an `assert()` statement fails, it signifies a bug or unexpected state. 
This is used to verify conditions that should never be false and, if such a condition evaluates as false, it reverts the transaction without gas refund, primarily serving to detect developer mistakes.

For this case, the function is checking whether `amount` is less than or equal to `balance`, and if this condition is not met, it should be considered an expected error condition rather than a bug in the code. 
Therefore, using `require()` is more appropriate.
 
Recommendation:

Replace the `assert()` statement with `require()` to improve error handling & gas consumption and provide a clear reason for the revert in the event of the condition not being met.

Here's the modified code with the `assert()` statement replaced by `require()`:
```solidity
function _processDelegation(
    address source,
    address target,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 balance = getBalanceForDelegate(source);

--  assert(amount <= balance);
++  require(amount <= balance, "Insufficient balance");

    deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(target);
    transferBetweenDelegators(source, target, amount);
    
    emit DelegationProcessed(source, target, amount);
}
```
The change from `assert()` to `require()` in the `_processDelegation` function provides improved error handling, better gas efficiency, and clearer reasoning for reverts, enhancing user-friendliness and contract robustness.


2. LOW: ERC20MultiDelegate::_reimburse() - No check for bool return value for transferFrom() method.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L148

The concern arises from the absence of checks on the success or boolean return values of token transfers. It's advisable to either use `safeTransferFrom` or explicitly check return values, aligning with industry-standard recommendations

RISKS:

The potential consequences and risks of not checking the return value of the `transferFrom` method in the `_reimburse` function depend on the behavior of the `token` contract and how it handles failed transfers. 

Potential issues:

- Lack of Error Handling: 
If the `transferFrom` method in the `token` contract encounters an error, it will return `false`, indicating that the transfer failed. 
However, if the `_reimburse` function does not check this return value, it may not be aware of transfer failures. This could lead to a situation where tokens are not transferred as expected, but the function assumes they have been.

- Inconsistent State: Without checking the return value, the internal state of the contract may be inconsistent with the actual token ownership. For example, the contract might record a successful reimbursement, even if the token transfer failed.

Recommendations:

Use OZ's `safeTransferFrom` or explicit return value checks, in accordance with industry-standard recommendations.

For using the explicit return value checks approach (until OZ's `safeTransferFrom` is implemented):

You can use the return value from `token.transferFrom` to handle errors and take appropriate actions, such as logging the failure, reverting the transaction, notifying the user, etc.

Here's an example of how you can modify the `_reimburse` function to handle transfer failures: 
```solidity
function _reimburse(address source, uint256 amount) internal {
    address proxyAddressFrom = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, source);
--  token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
++  bool transferSuccess = token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
++  require(transferSuccess, "Token transfer failed"); // Add error handling

    // Rest of the function logic
}
```
By adding this error handling code, you can ensure that the contract responds appropriately to failed token transfers, reducing the potential risks associated with not checking the return value.


3. QA: ERC20MultiDelegate::setUri() - Method `_setURI(uri)` does not adhere to the EIP-1155 specification, as it does not emit an event, however there's a valid explanation for the reason in ERC1155.sol contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L152

Valid explanation in ERC1155.sol contract on L244-L245:
`Because these URIs cannot be meaningfully represented by the {URI} event, this function emits no events.`

```solidity
    function setUri(string memory uri) external onlyOwner {
        _setURI(uri);
    }
```

4. LOW: The custom/non-standard implementation of the ERC20 method `token.transferFrom()` in the ERC20MultiDelegate::`transferBetweenDelegators()` function fails the CEI pattern and executes the low level token transfer before checking allowance.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed47c841a19abd26681110a26ef03c446da2b6dd/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L170

Since the `transferFrom()` is called by the `transferBetweenDelegators()` function, I deem this as in scope for this contest as it can directly affect the correct & safe functioning of the ERC20MultiDelegate contract.

Affected code where it fails to check allowance before making the transfer, and recommended changes:
```solidity
    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
    --  _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);

        uint256 currentAllowance = _allowances[sender][_msgSender()];
        require(currentAllowance >= amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance");
        
    ++  _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
    
        unchecked {
            _approve(sender, _msgSender(), currentAllowance - amount);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
5. LOW:

Regarding the ability of a delegator to self-delegate and potentially enable double voting power for themselves, it appears that there might be a vulnerability in the contract that could lead to this situation. Let's examine the relevant portions of the code and potential risks:

In the `transferBetweenDelegators` function, the contract transfers tokens from one proxy contract to another. Specifically, it uses the `token.transferFrom` function to transfer voting tokens from `proxyAddressFrom` to `proxyAddressTo`. This operation involves both actual token transfers and ERC1155 voting power representing "token" shares minted to the target delegates, with a subsequent burn from the source delegate.

The risk here lies in the possibility of a delegator self-delegating by transferring tokens to another proxy contract controlled by the same delegator. In this scenario, the delegator could temporarily double their voting power.

For example, if Delegator A has 100 voting tokens in their proxy contract, they could transfer 100 tokens to another proxy contract owned by the same Delegator A. In this way, both proxy contracts would temporarily have the same voting power. However, this self-delegation can only occur once because after the initial transfer, Delegator A's voting power in the source proxy contract would be reduced to zero. Subsequent self-delegations would not provide additional voting power because the source proxy contract would have no tokens left.

To confirm if this is a vulnerability, you should review the `_moveVotingPower` method and related logic within the contract. Specifically, ensure that the contract correctly handles self-delegation and that it enforces the intended behavior.

In some contexts, self-delegation is allowed, while in others, it may not be permitted. It's essential to validate if the contract aligns with the intended design and, if necessary, implement safeguards to prevent double voting through self-delegation if it is not allowed.
