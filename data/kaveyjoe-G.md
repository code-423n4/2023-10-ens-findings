## [G-01] - Gas price manipulation

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the gas prices in their favor by creating a large number of proxy contracts and then withdrawing them, causing a sharp increase in gas prices. This could lead to an uneconomical gas market and make it difficult for other users to execute transactions.

**Code Snippet:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, proxyAddress, amount);
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, proxyAddress, amount, 0x0 gasPrice);
     }
By setting the gasPrice parameter to zero, we ensure that the transferFrom() function call does not consume additional gas, reducing the risk of gas price manipulation.

## [G-02] - Overpayment attack

**Description:** If the getBalanceForDelegate() function is called without checking the balance first, an attacker could overpay the delegator and drain the funds from the contract.

**Code Snippet:**

     function _processDelegation(
         address source,
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         token.transferFrom(source, target, amount);
     }
**Optimized Code:**

     function _processDelegation(
         address source,
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         require(amount <= getBalanceForDelegate(source), "Overpayment detected");
         //...
         token.transferFrom(source, target, amount);
     }

By adding a require() statement, we ensure that the amount passed to the transferFrom() function call is less than or equal to the delegate's available balance, preventing overpayment attacks.

## [G-03] - Unnecessary redeployment of proxies

**Description:** If the deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded() function is called repeatedly for the same delegate, it could result in unnecessary deployment of proxy contracts, leading to wasted gas and resources.

**Code Snippet:**

     function deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(
         address delegate
     ) internal returns (address) {
         //...
         if (bytecodeSize == 0) {
             new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);
             emit ProxyDeployed(delegate, proxyAddress);
         }
         return proxyAddress;
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(
         address delegate
     ) internal returns (address) {
         //...
         if (bytecodeSize == 0 && !isAlreadyDeployed(delegate)) {
             new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);
             emit ProxyDeployed(delegate, proxyAddress);
         }
         return proxyAddress;
     }

     function isAlreadyDeployed(address delegate) internal view returns (bool) {
         //...
     }

By adding a new function isAlreadyDeployed() and checking its return value before deploying a new proxy contract, we can avoid unnecessary redeployments and reduce gas consumption.

## [G-04] - Reentrancy attacks

**Description:** If the createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer() function is called during a transaction, an attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the transfer() function and perform a reentrancy attack, allowing them to drain funds from the contract.

**Code Snippet:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, proxyAddress, amount);
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         transact({
             from: msg.sender,
             to: proxyAddress,
             value: amount,
             gas: 0x17a4 dynamics, // 17a4 is the gas limit for the relayer
             gasPrice: 0x0, // Set gas price to zero to prevent reentrancy attacks
         });
     }

By using the transact() function instead of token.transferFrom() and setting the gasPrice parameter to zero, we ensure that the createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer() function does not consume additional gas and reduces the risk of reentrancy attacks.

## [G-05] - Frontrunning attacks

**Description:** Miners could frontrun the execution of the transfer() function calls within the createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer() function, resulting in miners gaining an unfair advantage in terms of gas fees and potentially draining funds from the contract.

**Code Snippet:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         token.transferFrom(msg.sender, proxyAddress, amount);
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(
         address target,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         micRecedeablyTransferFrom(msg.sender, proxyAddress, amount);
     }

     function micRecedeablyTransferFrom(
         address from,
         address to,
         uint256 amount
     ) internal {
         //...
         emit MicRecedeaeousEvent(from, to, amount);
     }

By introducing a custom event MicRecedeaeousEvent() and listening to it in the micRecedeablyTransferFrom() function, we can detect and prevent frontrunning attacks.

## [G-06] - Denial of Service (DoS)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the network with requests to the transfer() function, potentially crashing the node and preventing legitimate transactions from executing.

**Code Snippet:**

     function transfer(
         address recipient,
         uint256 amount
     ) external {
         //...
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function transfer(
         address recipient,
         uint256 amount
     ) external {
         //...
         require(recipient.isCancellable(), "Recipient must be cancellable");
         //...
     }

By adding a require() statement, we ensure that the recipient address must be cancellable, which prevents non-cancellable addresses from receiving tokens and reduces the risk of DoS attacks.

## [G-07] - Lack of access control

**Description:** There is no access control mechanism in place to prevent unauthorized users from calling the setUri() function and changing the URI value, potentially breaking the functionality of the contract.

**Code Snippet:**

     function setUri(string memory _newUri) external {
         uri = _newUri;
     }

**Optimized Code:**

     function setUri(string memory _newUri) external {
         require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can change the URI");
         uri = _newUri;
     }
By adding a require() statement, we ensure that only the owner of the contract can call the setUri() function and change the URI value, enforcing access control and preventing unauthorized changes.

## [G-08] - Lack of input validation

**Description:** The retrievesProxyContractAddress() function does not validate the input correctly, which can cause an invalid address to be generated, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Code Snippet:**

     function retrievesProxyContractAddress() internal returns (address) {
         //...
     }
**Optimized Code:**

     function retrievesProxyContractAddress() internal returns (address) {
         //...
         require(message.sender != address(0), "Invalid address");
         //...
     }
By adding a require() statement, we ensure that the retrievesProxyContractAddress() function validates the input correctly and rejects invalid addresses, improving security and preventing unexpected behavior.
