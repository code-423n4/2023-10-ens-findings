## Lack of Check can cause loop to become unbounded

The [_delegateMulti](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed25379c06e42c8218eb1e80e141412496950685/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L65C4-L69C17) has no check to see if the amount is zero. This enables a person to feed large amounts of sources and targets while keeping the amounts to zero which can result in unbounded loop.

inside the loop,
```solidity
uint256 amount = amounts[transferIndex];
if(amount < 0){
    continue;
}
```

## Argument naming is confusing.

In most functions the argument is named as `delegate` while this is true for the most part, the term 'delegate' is used interchangeably throughout the contract. Suppose in case of a `_reimburse`, the call goes to `retrieveProxyContractAddress()` in which the choice `delegate` might not be the best choice.

## Used named imports.

Using named imports is a good coding convention that can increase the overall quality of the codebase.

```solidity
import {Address} from "@openzeppelin/utils/Address.sol";

import {Ownable} from "@openzeppelin/access/Ownable.sol";
import {ERC1155} from "@openzeppelin/token/ERC1155/ERC1155.sol";
import {ERC20Votes} from "@openzeppelin/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Votes.sol";
import {Math} from "@openzeppelin/utils/math/Math.sol";
```
## Internal function name can be prefixed with '_' .

Internal function names should be prefixed with '_' . This naming convention is followed in `_processDelegation` , `_reimburse` , `_delegateMulti` but not in other internal functions used in the contract.

```
function _createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer() internal {}
function _transferBetweenDelegators() internal {}
function _deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded() internal {}
function _getBalanceForDelegate() internal {}
function _retrieveProxyContractAddress()internal  {}
```

## Lack of Comments

This code is generally clean and strategically straightforward; even so, comments can further enhance the experience for both auditors and developers. In the context of this codebase, I believe comments are generally effective in delivering value to readers. Comments are crucial because there are two phases of finding bugs in mathematical operations in a code. Usually, the easier one for most auditors is to spot a discrepancy between the intention the comments documenting the code transmit and the code itself. The other one is questioning the mathematical foundations and correctness of the formulas used. Being specific when commenting on the expected outcomes of calculations within the code greatly aids to address the former.
