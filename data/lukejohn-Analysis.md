Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
1) Some improvement can be made by adding mapping(address => address) proxyAddresses;

Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
1) I wrote a test to test all cases, with a focus on delegateMulti().
2) Draw a diagram to show how delegates and delegatees are related. 

    Architecture recommendations
1) A very good architecture already. 
2) Maybe add a whitelist for the delegatees. 

    Codebase quality analysis
1) Some of the code can be improved by adding mapping(address => address) proxyAddresses so that it is easier to return the proxy address of a given delegate.


    Centralization risks
1)  No centralization risk


    Mechanism review
1)  Some edges cases can be detected such as zero address check and zero amount check

    Systemic risks
1) Not aware of any system risk
