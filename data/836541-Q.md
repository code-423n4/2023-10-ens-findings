## Description
Different delegations for the same `delegatee` shares the same Proxy Delegator.

## Proof of Concept 
1. Method `deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded` creates a new Proxy Delegator in the following snippet:
```solidity
        if (bytecodeSize == 0) {
            new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);
            emit ProxyDeployed(delegate, proxyAddress);
        }
```
There's nothing unique in this Creation, because salt and deployer will always be the same, so different users that delegate to the same address are sharing the same Proxy Delegators with the same erc20 tokens.

## Impact
If a vulnerability is discovered later, any user can frontrun any one to make sure he will use the same Proxy Delegator as someone else and attack it.

## Mitigation
Use `msg.sender` as salt.
