## Gas(Mana) Optimization Report for [ENS](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens) by K42

### Possible Gas(Mana) Optimizations in [ERC20MultiDelegate.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol)  

Possible Optimization 1 = Use a Mapping specifically for [Proxy Addresses](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L176): 
- Instead of calculating the proxy address every time, store it in a ``mapping`` after the first calculation.

After Optimization:




```solidity
mapping(address => address) public proxyAddresses;

// Then update:
function deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(address delegate) internal returns (address) {
    if (proxyAddresses[delegate] == address(0)) {
        // ... (existing code)
        proxyAddresses[delegate] = proxyAddress;
    }
    return proxyAddresses[delegate];
}
```




- Estimated gas saved: Approximately 5,000 - 8,000 gas per retrieval. Safe as long as the mapping is updated correctly. Reduces the need for ``EXTCODESIZE`` and ``KECCAK256``.

Possible Optimization 2 = Better optimize loop in [_delegateMulti()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L65C1-L116C6): 
- Use a single loop for all operations instead of separate loops for ``burning`` and ``minting``.

After Optimization:




```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
    // ... (existing code)
    if (i < sourcesLength) {
        _burn(msg.sender, sources[i], amounts[i]);
    }
    if (i < targetsLength) {
        _mint(msg.sender, targets[i], amounts[i], "");
    }
}
```




- Estimated gas saved = Approximately 1,000 - 2,000 gas per loop iteration. Completely safe as long as loop conditions are met.
