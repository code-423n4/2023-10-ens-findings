Function deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded checks if the proxy contract  has been deployed:
```
        // check if the proxy contract has already been deployed
               uint bytecodeSize;
        assembly {
            bytecodeSize := extcodesize(proxyAddress)
        }
```

Example:
```
 contract Hack {
 bool public isContract ;
 address public addr ;

 // When contract is being created , code size ( extcodesize ) is 0.
 // This will bypass the isContract () check
 constructor ( address _target ) {
 isContract = Target ( _target ). isContract ( address ( this ));
 addr = address ( this ); // Dpes not have code yet
 }
```
If invoked through a constructor this check will return 0 bytes because the caller contract has not been deployed.
This may cause unwanted behavior and be opened to other exploits.
May be this can be classified as medium?

Contract is inheriting from ERC1155 and Ownable
```
contract ERC20MultiDelegate is ERC1155, Ownable {
```
But in newer versions of Ownable it is used with a constructor, so if the newest version of Ownable is used it needs to be called with it's construcotr as ERC1155 like in the currentcontract:
```
constructor(
 ERC20Votes _token,
        string memory _metadata_uri
    ) ERC1155(_metadata_uri) {
        token = _token;
    }
```
