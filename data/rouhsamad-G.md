Gas optimization - The function `verify` initializes the variables `index` and `i` with a value of 0. In Solidity, memory variables are automatically initialized to their default values. For data type uint256, this default value is 0. Thus, explicitly setting these variables to 0 is redundant and results in unnecessary gas consumption.

Gas optimization - The `claimPeriodEnds` variable is initialized in the constructor and never modified again. `claimPeriodEnds` can be declared as and `immutable` variable.

Gas optimization - `createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer` and `_processDelegation` in `ERC20MultiDelegate` contract are checking whether `target` proxy delegator is deployed or not by first calculating the address and then fetching the code size using `extcodesize` opcode which will cost 2600 amount of gas on next calls after deployment (since we are not interacting with proxy delegator address after deployment). the gas cost of `extcodesize` opcode is variant depending on whether the address is in `touched_addresses` (100) or not (2600 in our case)
(when the proxy is deployed, the address of created contract is in `touched_addresses` hence 100 gas will be consumed on `extcodesize`)
recommended mitigation:
its suggested to keep track of whether a wallet has already deployed a proxy before or not

Gas optimization - `Math.min(sourcesLength, targetsLength)` and `Math.max(sourcesLength, targetsLength)` are calculated multiple times (depending on arrays size) within `_delegateMulti` function of `ERC20MultiDelegate` contract. its suggested to calculate this constant values before starting the loop and assignign them to a local variaable in order to decrease gas usage
