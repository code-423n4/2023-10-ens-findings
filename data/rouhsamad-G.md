Gas optimization - The function `verify` initializes the variables `index` and `i` with a value of 0. In Solidity, memory variables are automatically initialized to their default values. For data type uint256, this default value is 0. Thus, explicitly setting these variables to 0 is redundant and results in unnecessary gas consumption.

Gas optimization - The `claimPeriodEnds` variable is initialized in the constructor and never modified again. `claimPeriodEnds` can be declared as and `immutable` variable.
