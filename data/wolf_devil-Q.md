## Finding 1: Lack of Validation for Deployed Address
The deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded function does not contain validation to check if the deployedAddress matches the expected proxyAddress. This omission poses a security risk as it does not ensure that the contract has been deployed to the expected address.

#### Recommendation 1: Address Validation:

We recommend adding address validation to ensure that the deployed contract's address matches the expected proxyAddress. This can be achieved by comparing the proxyAddress with the actual address of the deployed contract. If the addresses do not match, an error or exception should be raised.

```solidity
    function deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded(
            address delegate
        ) internal returns (address) {
            address proxyAddress = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, delegate);
    
            // check if the proxy contract has already been deployed
            uint bytecodeSize;
            assembly {
                bytecodeSize := extcodesize(proxyAddress)
            }
    
            // if the proxy contract has not been deployed, deploy it
            if (bytecodeSize == 0) {
    -						new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);
    +           ERC20ProxyDelegator newDeployment = new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);
    +           require(address(newDeployment) == proxyAddress, "Address Mismatch");
                emit ProxyDeployed(delegate, proxyAddress);
            }
            return proxyAddress;
        }
 ```
