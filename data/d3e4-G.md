In the following, gas saved per call is according to the provided test's calling of `delegateMulti()`.

### [G-01] `_delegateMulti()` can be `delegateMulti()`
`delegateMulti()` only calls `_delegateMulti()` so `delegateMulti()` can be removed and its external role filled by `_delegateMulti()`.
Saves 54 gas per call and 5184 gas on deployment.

### [G-02] Cheaper comparison
Line 87, `transferIndex < Math.max(sourcesLength, targetsLength);` can be replaced by `transferIndex < amountsLength` since it is already checked that `Math.max(sourcesLength, targetsLength) == amountsLength` (L80).
Saves 308 gas per call and 2352 on deployment.

### [G-03] Only `else`
At line 104 `else if (transferIndex < targetsLength)` can be replaced by just `else` since `transferIndex < Math.max(sourcesLength, targetsLength)` so it cannot be >= to both.
Saves 44 gas per call and 2184 on deployment.

### [G-04] Unnecessary balance check
Lines 129 and 131
```solidity
uint256 balance = getBalanceForDelegate(source);

assert(amount <= balance);
```
may be removed. An ERC20 error would be thrown instead when it tries to transfer the same amount of ERC20Votes-tokens if the balance is insufficient.
Saves 1140 gas per call and 80623 on deployment.

### [G-05] Directly retrieve `token` instead of passing it as a parameter
`retrieveProxyContractAddress(ERC20Votes _token, address _delegate)` can replace it `_token` parameter and directly reference `token` which is stored in the contract.
Saves 20 gas per call and 23101 on deployment.

### [G-06] Do the `source`/`target` to proxy address conversion in `_delegateMulti()`
`_delegateMulti()` calls three functions, all of which take `source` and/or `target` parameters which are then converted to proxy addresses using `retrieveProxyContractAddress()`. `_processDelegation()` even performs this conversion twice on the same parameter.
This conversion can be done in `_delegateMulti()` on retrieval of `source` and `target` from their `sources[]` and `targets[]`. Use `deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded()` to convert `target`, and `retrieveProxyContractAddress()` to convert `source`. `_processDelegation()`, `_reimburse()` and `createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer()` should then instead take the proxy addresses as parameter.
In combination with [G-04] this reduces these functions to single lines, except for an event in the case of `_processDelegation()`, as well as `transferBetweenDelegators()` so it makes sense to also inline them. Refer to the revised code of all proposed gas optimizations below for clarity.
Saves 2814 per call and 25185 on deployment.

### Total gas savings
4379 (0.84%) gas per call and 138657 (3.36%) on deployment.
