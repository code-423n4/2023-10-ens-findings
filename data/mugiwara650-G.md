#`Math.max` being computed for same inputs multiple times

In the `_delegateMulti` method [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed25379c06e42c8218eb1e80e141412496950685/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L80) and [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/ed25379c06e42c8218eb1e80e141412496950685/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L87), the maximum value between `sourcesLength` and `targetsLength` is being computed multiple times. especially every iteration of the loop even though they aren't being changed anywhere else.
