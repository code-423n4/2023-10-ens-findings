## Summary
The ENS ERC20MultiDelegate.sol consists of two contracts, ERC20ProxyDelegator and ERC20MultiDelegate, which aim to facilitate the delegation of voting power in a decentralized governance system. The architecture involves a proxy pattern, where proxy delegator contracts are deployed to vote on behalf of the original delegator. The code utilizes `OpenZeppelin` contracts, ERC1155 for handling token balances, and ERC20Votes for voting functionalities.
## Scope of Audit 
`contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol`
## Architecture Description Overview:
1. Proxy Delegator Contract (ERC20ProxyDelegator):
a) Deployed by the utility contract (ERC20MultiDelegate).
b) Allows the delegator to vote on behalf of the original delegator.
c) Approves the utility contract to spend an unlimited amount of tokens on behalf of the user.
d) Delegates voting power to a specified delegate.
2. Utility Contract (ERC20MultiDelegate):
a) Inherits from ERC1155 and Ownable contracts.
b) Manages multiple delegation transfers between source and target delegates.
c) Uses proxy delegator contracts to handle the delegation process.
d) Emits events for proxy deployment and delegation processing.
e) Supports URI setting for ERC1155 metadata.
## Events And Functions Included:
### Events:
a) "ProxyDeployed": Triggered when a proxy delegator contract is deployed.
b) "DelegationProcessed": Triggered when a delegation transfer is processed between a source and target delegate.
### Functions:
a) "delegateMulti":  Initiates the delegation transfer process for multiple source and target delegates.
b) "setUri" : Allows the owner to set the URI for ERC1155 metadata.
c) "_delegateMulti" : Internal function for processing delegation transfers.
d) "_processDelegation" : Internal function for processing a delegation transfer between a source and target delegate.
e) "_reimburse":  Internal function for reimbursing any remaining source amounts after the delegation transfer.
f) "createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer":  Internal function to create a proxy delegator and transfer tokens to it.
g) "transferBetweenDelegators" :  Internal function to transfer tokens between two proxy delegator contracts.
h) "deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded" : Internal function to deploy a proxy delegator contract if not already deployed.
i) "getBalanceForDelegate" :  Internal function to get the balance of tokens for a specific delegate.
j) "retrieveProxyContractAddress" :  Private function to retrieve the address of the proxy delegator contract associated with a delegate.
## Codebase Quality:
Overall, I consider the quality of ENS ERC20MultiDelegate codebase to be excellent. The code appears to be very mature and well-developed.
## Systemic & Centralization Risks:
The analysis provided highlights several significant systemic and centralization risks present in the present ENS audit.
1) dependency risk:
It is observed that old and unsafe versions of Openzeppelin are used in the project, this should be updated to the latest one
2) centralization risks:
Proxy contracts may be deployed by a single entity, which might lead to centralization concerns.
## Conclusion:
The code demonstrates a decentralized delegation system using proxy contracts, leveraging OpenZeppelin standards. While the implementation appears robust, consideration of potential systemic and centralization risks are crucial before deploying the code in a production environment.
