### 1. Use cached length in loop.

In the function `_delegateMulti` loop condition always calls the function `Math.Max` to find the biggest number, but rather according to the design the that max value should ideally be equal to the `amountsLength`. So its better to use to the `amountsLength` instead of calculating maximum each time.
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L87

#### Fix:
```
        for (
            uint transferIndex;
            transferIndex < amountsLength;
            transferIndex++
        ) { ... }
```
### 2. If one array is bigger than the other, then each time a variable with `0x0` address will be created which will add some overhead gas. Its better to parse in specified conditions to reduce the gas usage.

Before:
  gas	                465144 gas
  transaction cost	385273 gas 
  execution cost	371561 gas 

After:
   gas	                448707 gas
   transaction cost	370980 gas 
   execution cost	357268 gas 
```
