### Advanced Analysis Report for [ERC20ProxyDelegator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L15C1-L20C2) and [ERC20MultiDelegate.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L25C1-L216C2)

#### Overview
- During this audit, I focused on making this analysis as constructive as possible and on gas optimizations. To being, the contracts serve as a delegation mechanism for ERC20Votes tokens. [ERC20ProxyDelegator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L15C1-L20C2) is a minimalist contract that performs approval and delegation during its construction. [ERC20MultiDelegate.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L25C1-L216C2) is a more intricate contract that allows for batch operations related to delegation.

#### Understanding the Ecosystem:
- **ERC20Votes**: Inherits from ERC20 and adds voting capabilities.
- **ERC20ProxyDelegator**: A single-use contract for immediate delegation upon deployment.
- **ERC20MultiDelegate**: A multi-functional contract for batch delegation, token transfers, and more.

#### Codebase Quality Analysis:
- The codebase is modular but lacks inline documentation, making it less accessible for contributors and auditors.

**1. [Structures and Libraries]**
- **Address Library**: Utilized for typecasting addresses.
- **Ownable**: Used for centralized access control, which could be a point of failure.

**2. [Function Complexity]**
- **_delegateMulti**: Manages batch operations but lacks atomicity.
- **deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded**: Uses inline assembly to check if a contract exists, increasing the attack surface.

**3. [Data Storage]**
- **token**: ERC20Votes token, which is publicly accessible but not modifiable.
- **events**: Lacks comprehensive event logging, reducing transparency.

**4. [Assembly Usage]**
- **deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded**: Inline assembly increases complexity and should be isolated in a separate internal function with a clear comment explaining its necessity.

**5. [Error Handling]**
- **assert**: Used for invariant checks but could lead to a denial-of-service if triggered.
- **require**: Used for input validation but lacks custom error messages for better debugging.

**6. [Access Control]**
- **Ownable**: Centralizes control, making the contract vulnerable to single-point failures.

**7. [Error Handling]**
- Utilizes `require` and `assert` but lacks revert reasons and custom errors, reducing debuggability.

#### Architecture Recommendations:
- Implement role-based access control to replace `Ownable`.
- Isolate inline assembly code into well-documented internal functions.
- Implement a function to allow the owner to pause the contract in case of detected vulnerabilities.

#### Centralization Risks:
- **Possible Risk**: Single owner control.
- **Potential Impact**: Central point of failure.
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Transition to a DAO or multi-signature mechanism for administrative functions.

#### Mechanism Review:
- The delegation mechanism is straightforward but lacks a way to revoke delegation.
- No upgradeability mechanism for the `token` address, making the contract rigid.

#### Systemic Risks:
- The contract is not upgradable, making it immutable against any future vulnerabilities or improvements.

#### Areas of Concern:
- The use of `assert` for invariant checks could lead to funds being locked.
- Inline assembly increases complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
- No mechanism to revoke delegation once made.

#### Codebase Analysis:
- A formal verification could provide a mathematical proof of the contract's correctness.
- The contract lacks modularization of complex logic, making it harder to audit and verify.

#### Recommendations:
- Implement custom errors for more effective and efficient debuggability.
- I recommend adding a `renounceOwnership` function for full decentralization.
- Use formal verification tools to prove the contract's correctness.
- Implement comprehensive and specific event logging for all state-changing operations.

- [ERC20ProxyDelegator.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L15C1-L20C2): Simplistic and does its job but lacks flexibility.
- [ERC20MultiDelegate.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L25C1-L216C2): Feature-rich but complex, increasing the risk of vulnerabilities. 

#### Conclusion:
- While the contracts serve their purpose, they lack in areas of modularity, upgradability, and decentralization. A more robust architecture with these considerations could significantly improve the contracts.
