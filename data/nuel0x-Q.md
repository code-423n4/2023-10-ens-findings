Calls to `getBalanceForDelegate()` and `assert()` Line [129](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L129) and [131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L131) respectively, can be omitted because the call to internal `_burnBatch()` from OZ ERC1155 in Line [111](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-ens/blob/main/contracts/ERC20MultiDelegate.sol#L111) would revert with more meaningful error message should sender balance for that ID be less than the amount used in call to `_processDelegation()`.
