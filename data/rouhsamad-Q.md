# L-1 - No Balance Verification in _reimburse Function:
_reimburse function (unlike `_processDelegation`) is not checking whether `msg.sender` has enought tokens to withdraw from `source`:

    function _reimburse(address source, uint256 amount) internal {
        address proxyAddressFrom = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, source);
        token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
    }

Recommended mitigation steps:
check if `msg.sender` is eligible for withdrawing `amount` from proxy contract of `source`

    function _reimburse(address source, uint256 amount) internal {
        uint256 balance = getBalanceForDelegate(source);
        assert(amount <= balance);
        address proxyAddressFrom = retrieveProxyContractAddress(token, source);
        token.transferFrom(proxyAddressFrom, msg.sender, amount);
    }

# Non-critical-1 - ClaimPeriodEnds is not validated to be more than current timestamp:
The constructor for the contract sets the claimPeriodEnds to the passed _claimPeriodEnds parameter. However, there's no validation to ensure that _claimPeriodEnds is in the future relative to the contract's deployment time.

Recommended mitigation steps:
To avoid potential issues, it's advisable to add a validation check within the constructor to ensure that _claimPeriodEnds is greater than the current block.timestamp.




# Non-critical-2 - Contract has only one owner, probably an EOA:
Currently, the smart contract bestows elevated privileges solely to the "owner", which is likely an EOA in this context. While this simplifies access control, it also centralizes authority and exposes the system to potential vulnerabilities, especially if the owner's private key is compromised. High-stake decisions made through this owner-centric model lack the necessary checks and balances, potentially leading to irreversible and damaging actions. (such as sweeping tokens from the contract by a malicious owner)

Recommended mitigation steps:
role-based access control is a great way to secure authority within the contract. It allows assigning specific permissions to different addresses based on their roles. its also recommended to use a multi-signature wallet for each role.
Example:
    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant SWEEPER_ROLE = keccak256("SWEEPER_ROLE");
