## Simplifying Proxy Deployment Event
The event ProxyDeployed can be simplified by omitting the proxyAddress parameter since it can be computed from the delegate and token parameters, which are constant. Here's a revised event definition:
````
event ProxyDeployed(address indexed delegate);
````
This simplification maintains the relevant information and simplifies the contract readability.
