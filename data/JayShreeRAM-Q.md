## 1. Missing Constructor Visibility

Location: ERC20ProxyDelegator contract, constructor function.
Description: The constructor function is missing a visibility specifier. It should be explicitly specified as public.

     constructor(ERC20Votes _token, address _delegate) public {
         ...
     }

## 2. Approval of Wrong Address

Location: ERC20ProxyDelegator contract, constructor function.
Description: In the ERC20ProxyDelegator constructor, msg.sender is being approved for the maximum allowance. This might not always be the correct address for this approval. It's recommended to double-check if this behavior is intentional.

## 3. Potential Gas Limit Issues

Location: deployProxyDelegatorIfNeeded function.
Description: Deploying contracts with a salt value of 0 can sometimes lead to gas limit issues. It is crucial to ensure that the provided salt value is appropriate for your specific use case.

      new ERC20ProxyDelegator{salt: 0}(token, delegate);

## 4. No Check for Zero Addresses

Location: ERC20ProxyDelegator contract, constructor function.
Description: The _delegate parameter in ERC20ProxyDelegator constructor should be checked for a non-zero address to prevent potential issues.

## 5. Event Emission in Proxy Deployment

Location: ERC20ProxyDelegator contract, constructor function.
Description: Emitting an event in the constructor of ERC20ProxyDelegator might cause issues. It is generally better practice to emit events outside of constructors.

## 6. retrieveProxyContractAddress Function

Location: retrieveProxyContractAddress function.
Description: The retrieveProxyContractAddress function creates a proxy contract address based on a hash. It's important to be aware that this method might not be the most secure way to handle proxy contracts. Proxy contracts can have security implications and are usually implemented with additional checks and safeguards.

## 7. Missing Error Handling

Location: Various functions (e.g., transferBetweenDelegators, createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer, etc.).
Description: The code lacks error handling for potential failure cases (e.g., if transferFrom or approve calls fail). It's recommended to include appropriate error handling mechanisms.

## Recommendations
- Thoroughly review and revise the constructor function in ERC20ProxyDelegator to ensure it has the correct visibility specifier.

- Double-check the intention behind approving msg.sender for the maximum allowance in ERC20ProxyDelegator.

- Ensure that the salt value of 0 is appropriate for your specific use case, as it might cause gas limit issues.

- Add a check for non-zero _delegate address in the ERC20ProxyDelegator constructor.

- Emit events outside of constructors for better code organization.

- Review the method of creating proxy contracts and consider additional security measures if necessary.

- Implement error handling for potential failure cases in functions like transferFrom or approve.
