### L-1 Useless check can't prevent common use cases
The check at the line L#131 just tries to duplicate check at `_burnBatch` function but can not prevent cases when users split tokens amount from a `source` to many `targets`. Consider removing this check as useless to improve readability and reduce gas consumption. Then the `getBalanceForDelegate` function also can be removed.
```solidity
129        uint256 balance = getBalanceForDelegate(source);
130
131        assert(amount <= balance);

192    function getBalanceForDelegate(
193        address delegate
194    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
195        return ERC1155(this).balanceOf(msg.sender, uint256(uint160(delegate)));
196    }
```

The check at `_burnBatch` function:
```solidity
            uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
            require(fromBalance >= amount, "ERC1155: burn amount exceeds balance");
```

### L-2 Variables `source` and `target` with `address(0)` values are never used
There is no necessity in conditions at the lines L#90-95. The type casting can be joined with conditions at lines L#98-107.
It reduces gas consumption and improves readability.
The current implementation
```solidity
            address source = transferIndex < sourcesLength
                ? address(uint160(sources[transferIndex]))
                : address(0);
            address target = transferIndex < targetsLength
                ? address(uint160(targets[transferIndex]))
                : address(0);
            uint256 amount = amounts[transferIndex];

            if (transferIndex < Math.min(sourcesLength, targetsLength)) {
                // Process the delegation transfer between the current source and target delegate pair.
                _processDelegation(source, target, amount);
            } else if (transferIndex < sourcesLength) {
                // Handle any remaining source amounts after the transfer process.
                _reimburse(source, amount);
            } else if (transferIndex < targetsLength) {
                // Handle any remaining target amounts after the transfer process.
                createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(target, amount);
            }
```
Proposed implementation
```solidity
            uint256 amount = amounts[transferIndex];

            if (transferIndex < Math.min(sourcesLength, targetsLength)) {                
                // Process the delegation transfer between the current source and target delegate pair.
                _processDelegation(address(uint160(sources[transferIndex])), address(uint160(targets[transferIndex])), amount);
            } else if (transferIndex < sourcesLength) {
                // Handle any remaining source amounts after the transfer process.
                _reimburse(address(uint160(sources[transferIndex])), amount);
            } else if (transferIndex < targetsLength) {
                // Handle any remaining target amounts after the transfer process.
                createProxyDelegatorAndTransfer(address(uint160(targets[transferIndex])), amount);
            }
```
